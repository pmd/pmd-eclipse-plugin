## How to contribute

You can contribute by testing the latest version, creating bug reports, or even forking
the repository on github and create pull requests. Any contributions are welcome!


### Testing the latest version

The plugin requires Java 17 for building.

Then simply build the plugin locally using maven:

    ./mvnw clean verify

You'll find the zipped update site in the folder `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.p2updatesite/target/`.
Point eclipse to the zip file in this folder as an update-site and install the
latest SNAPSHOT version.


### Bug Reports

Please file any bug reports in the bug tracker at github:

<https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/issues>

### GitHub Repository

Just fork the the GitHub Repository pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin and create a pull request.

<https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/>

To get started, see also the next section.


## Short Developer's Guide

### Compilation
Simply run `./mvn clean verify`. The plugin's update site will be generated in
`net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.p2updatesite/target/repository`. You can use this directory as
an update site to install the new plugin version directly into your Eclipse.

### Importing the projects in Eclipse
Make sure you have the Maven Integration (m2e - http://eclipse.org/m2e/) installed. Then you can
import *Existing Maven Projects*.
You should see 6 projects:

* net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse - that's the feature
* net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.p2updatesite - generates the update site
* net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.parent - the parent pom project
* net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.plugin - the actual plugin code
* net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.plugin.test - the (unit) tests for the plugin
* net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.plugin.test.fragment - an example extension of the plugin used during the tests

### Debugging
You can run eclipse with debugging enabled and connect to it via remote debugging:

    eclipse -data workspace-directory -vmargs -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000


### Releasing and updating the official eclipse update site

The update site is hosted on github as a Github Pages site of the repository
<https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin-p2-site/>.

The release script running on Github Actions will automatically update the repository pmd-eclipse-plugin-p2-site and
add the new release, update the repository metadata (compositeContent.xml and compositeArtifacts.xml
as well as index.md) and push the changes.

The release happens in two phases:

1.  Update the repository locally to prepare the new version:
    *   Update the changelog
    *   Update the versions
    *   Create a tag
    *   Update the changelog for the next version
    *   Update the versions
2.  Push the changes and the tag. The [Github Actions build](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/actions) will
    then publish the new version on [update site](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin-p2-site/) and
    [github releases](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/releases). It will also upload the update site
    to [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd/files/pmd-eclipse/zipped/) and create a sourceforge
    [blog entry](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/news/).


#### Script

See `do-release.sh`.

Verify, that the zipped update site has been uploaded to
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/releases) and [sourceforge](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-eclipse-plugin-p2-site/)
and that a [news blog entry](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/news/) has been created on sourceforge.

### Updating the used PMD version
The parent pom contains the property `pmd.version`. This is used inside the plugin module, to resolve the dependencies.
In order to change the PMD version, change this property and rebuild (`mvn clean package`). In case PMD has some
changed (added/removed) transitive dependencies, you'll need to update `n.s.p.e.plugin/META-INF/MANIEFEST.MF` as well.
All transitive dependencies are copied into the folder `n.s.p.e.plugin/target/lib` during the build.
