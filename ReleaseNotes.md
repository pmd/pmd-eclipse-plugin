*   Marker Icons: Instead of the geometrical figures, the old icons for the PMD markers can
    be selected again:

### New and noteworthy

*   Filtering by priority has been revamped. In both views "Violation Outline" and "Violation Overview" you can
    enable and disable the priorities. Changes in one view affects the other view as well as the markers displayed
    in the files. The selected priorities are stored in the preferences. PMD is not rerun when the priority filter
    is changed. The markers are only hidden instead. Changing the priority filter therefore affects the settings under
    General, Editors, Text Editors, Annotation for PMD Marker Annotations.

### Fixed Issues

*   [#56](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/issues/56): PMD not filtering
*   [#85](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/issues/85): Gutter Markers not Configured Color

*   In `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.ui.priority.PriorityDescriptor` the following methods are deprecated
    for removal:
    *   `getImageDescriptor()`
    *   `getImage(Display)`
    *   `getImage(Display, int)`
*   In `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.ui.priority.PriorityDescriptorCache` the method `dumpTo(PrintStream)` is
    deprecated for removal.
*   The whole class `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.ui.views.AbstractViolationLabelProvider` is deprecated
    for removal.
*   In `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.plugin.PMDPlugin` the method `getOpenFiles()` is deprecated
    for removal.
*   The class `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.ui.views.PriorityFilter` must not be instantiated directly
    in the future. Therefore the public constructor has been deprecated. Additionally the following methods
    are deprecated for removal:
    *   `setPriorityFilterList(List<Integer>)`
    *   `getPriorityFilterList()`
    *   `addPriorityToList(Integer)`
    *   `removePriorityFromList(Integer)`
    *   `setPriorityFilterListFromString(String, String)`
    *   `getPriorityFilterListAsString(String)`
*   In `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.ui.views.ViolationOverview` the method `getPriorityFilterList()`
    is deprecated for removal.
*   The whole class `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.util.PriorityUtil` is deprecated for removal.

## 07-March-2019: 4.1.0.v20190307-2036

This is a minor release.

### New and noteworthy

*   Updated PMD to 6.12.0
*   The package `name.herlin` is deprecated and will be removed with the next major version of the plugin.
*   PMD markers are now problem markers again. This means, that rule violations appear in the Problem View.
    The project property "Handle high priority violations as Eclipse errors" now works again.
*   The PMD markers are now also visible on the overview ruler. They can be customized or disabled via
    workspace preferences, General, Editors, Text Editors, Annotations.
*   In PMD's general preferences, there is a new option "Determine applicable file types automatically". This new
    option is enabled by default. When enabled, only the files of the languages, for which rules are active,
    are considered. This is a fix for [bug #88](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/issues/88).

## 20-December-2018: 4.0.18.v20181220-1448

### New and noteworthy

*   Updated PMD to 6.10.0
*   Eclipse SimRel 2018-09 and 2018-12 is supported.
    To do this, the plugin doesn't expose log4j for other plugins anymore.
    (the package `org.apache.log4j` is not exported anymore). In case you used this in a fragment,
    you should now use the eclipse platform logging facilities.

## 12-April-2018: 4.0.16.v20180412-0833

### New and noteworthy

*   Updated PMD to 6.2.0
*   At least Java 1.7 is required now.
*   Two new options under Preferences: "Show PMD violations overview when checking code" and "Show PMD violations
    outline when checking code". If these options are checked, then theses PMD views are shown automatically,
    when PMD check is executed for a project. This behaves similar like "Show PMD perspective", but just doesn't
    switch the current perspective.
*   PMD is now only executed automatically, if the option "Check code after saving" is enabled. This allows
    to simply disable automatic PMD checks temporarily. Executing PMD via the project's context menu "Check Code"
    is not affected and can still be used to manually execute PMD to update the markers.

### Fixed Issues

*   Fixed PMD is changing encoding of source code ([bug #1386](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1386/))

**API Changes**:

*   The package `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.core.rulesets` including sub-packages has been removed from the plugin.
    It won't export these package anymore. The purpose of this package was probably to provide a way of serializing
    and deserializing rulesets. As only the writer has been implemented and the reader was missing, it's not useful.
    If you need to read/write rulesets, use the core PMD functionality provided by `net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleSetWriter`.
    In order to read it back, use `net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleSetFactory`.
