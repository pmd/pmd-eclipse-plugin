* New Git default branch - "main":  
  We are joining the Git community and updating "master" to "main". Using the term "master" for the main
  development branch can be offensive to some people. Existing versions of Git have been always capable of
  working with any branch name and since 2.28.0 (July 2020) the default initial branch is configurable
  (`init.defaultBranch`). Since October 2020, the default branch for new repositories on GitHub
  is "main". Finally, PMD will also use this new name for the main branch in all our own repositories.

* Beginning with version 7 of this plugin, only the last four eclipse releases are supported. The plugin
  might still work with older versions, but it's only developed and tested against the newer versions.

* The version number of the PMD Eclipse Plugin now is synchronized with the supported and used PMD version.
  For Bugfixes in the PMD Eclipse Plugin only, a new version is released with the same major, minor, and patch,
  but a new qualifier only.

* The minimum required Java version is Java 8.

* The PMD Designer can't be started from within the plugin anymore. Please install
  [PMD Designer](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer) separately when needed.

### New and noteworthy

*   Filtering by priority has been revamped. In both views "Violation Outline" and "Violation Overview" you can
    enable and disable the priorities. Changes in one view affects the other view as well as the markers displayed
    in the files. The selected priorities are stored in the preferences. PMD is not rerun when the priority filter
    is changed. The markers are only hidden instead. Changing the priority filter therefore affects the settings under
    General, Editors, Text Editors, Annotation for PMD Marker Annotations.

### Fixed Issues

*   [#56](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/issues/56): PMD not filtering

## 20-December-2018: 4.0.18.v20181220-1448

### New and noteworthy

*   Updated PMD to 6.10.0
*   Eclipse SimRel 2018-09 and 2018-12 is supported.
    To do this, the plugin doesn't expose log4j for other plugins anymore.
    (the package `org.apache.log4j` is not exported anymore). In case you used this in a fragment,
    you should now use the eclipse platform logging facilities.

### New and noteworthy

*   This is only a bugfix release.

### Fixed Issues

*   [#52](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/issues/52): Eclipse Internal Error - Out of Memory
*   [#57](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/pull/57): De-duplicate project ruleset when loading the project properties


## 12-April-2018: 4.0.16.v20180412-0833

### New and noteworthy

*   Updated PMD to 6.2.0
*   At least Java 1.7 is required now.
*   Two new options under Preferences: "Show PMD violations overview when checking code" and "Show PMD violations
    outline when checking code". If these options are checked, then theses PMD views are shown automatically,
    when PMD check is executed for a project. This behaves similar like "Show PMD perspective", but just doesn't
    switch the current perspective.
*   PMD is now only executed automatically, if the option "Check code after saving" is enabled. This allows
    to simply disable automatic PMD checks temporarily. Executing PMD via the project's context menu "Check Code"
    is not affected and can still be used to manually execute PMD to update the markers.

### Fixed Issues

*   [#20](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/issues/20): category.xml maybe broken
*   [#29](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/issues/29): Processing errors without cause

**API Changes**:

*   The package `net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.core.rulesets` including sub-packages has been removed from the plugin.
    It won't export these package anymore. The purpose of this package was probably to provide a way of serializing
    and deserializing rulesets. As only the writer has been implemented and the reader was missing, it's not useful.
    If you need to read/write rulesets, use the core PMD functionality provided by `net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleSetWriter`.
    In order to read it back, use `net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleSetFactory`.

## v3.1.6 - 09/06/2006

### UPDATED : Architecture refactoring

This version is a major enhancement from previous ones.
While this is not visible, it includes a complete refactoring of the
plugin architecture necessary to ease future evolutions.

The consequence is that any preferences customizations from older versions will be lost.
Project properties should be kept.

The suggested update procedure is to:
1. disable PMD from all your projects
2. disable then uninstall PMD from your Eclipse
3. install new version


### UPDATED : PMD v3.7

**JSP FILES ARE NOT SUPPORTED IN THIS VERSION YET**

### UPDATED : Performance issues

This version include major performances enhancements:
* process files that are only included in source directories
* by default, derived files are excluded
  (this is an option of the project properties)
* heavy statistics computation has been shutdown (#violations/loc & #violations/method)
* refactor the markers application to use uptodate Eclipe features
* limit the number of reported violations per file per rule
  the default is set to 5 and can be changed in the preferences.

Now the plugin overhead to PMD should be only few hundreds of milliseconds (depends of
the #files to process and #violations generated of course).

### UPDATED : The legacy Violation View has been removed

The old violation view has been removed to the benefit of the new PMD Perspective
which is more efficient.

To obtain the same kind of view, simply use the standard Problems view.

### UPDATED : Make CPD working set aware

Running CPD now benefits of the working set selected for the project.

### UPDATED : Log files preferences

Now the logging properties can be set in the preferences dialog.
You can choose the logging level (default to WARN) and the logging file name and
location (default to the standard pmd-eclipse.log file in the Eclipse install
directory).

### UPDATED : Default review to PMD style

By default, the review comment style is the standard PMD style (// NOPMD comment) and
no more the former Eclipse style (// @PMD:REVIEW...).

This can be changed in the preferences dialog.

Note that the Eclipse style is considered deprecated and will be removed in a next version.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* Reconfigure the rebuild command to better handle huge projects
* Add the include derived files option
* make CPD "working set aware"
* remove some dead code
* limit the number of reported violations per file and per rule (default to 5)
* Add the possibility to use the PMD violation review style

## v3.1.0 - 04/07/2005

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU DELETE THE ruleset.xml FILE IN YOUR
.metadata/plugins/net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse DIRECTORY BEFORE UPGRADING.
Well, it should works with it. But if you have any problem, please try to delete it
before requesting support.

### FIXED/UPDATED : CPD report 

Because the bug #1190624 cannot be fixed, the CPD integration has been refactored.
Now CPD can be launched on one project at a time only.
The results are produced in a report file inside the report folder.
The SimpleRenderer is used to render the report.

### UPDATED: Works on Eclipse v3.1

This new version now works both on Eclipse v3.0 and Eclipse v3.1

### UPDATED: PMD v3.2

This version is packaged with PMD v3.2

### UPDATED: Support for Java 5.0 source files

Now the plugin works for projects that are targeted to Java 5.0

### UPDATED: Project properties

In consequence of upgrading to Eclipse v3.1, project properties management has
been reviewed. Now project properties are stored in a .pmd file at the project root.
If you do not explicitly use the .ruleset file, you can delete it.

### NEW: Rulesets extension point

The PMD core plugin now define the net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.core.rulesets extension point.
This extension point allows fragment developers to declare their customs rulesets so that
they appears in the drop down list when you request to import rulesets.
This extension point allows also to declare rulesets that will be automatically loaded
when creating a brand new workspace.

For implementation details, a sample is best. A sample fragment project is committed in
the CVS. The module name is "pmd-eclipse-test-fragment".

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* Migrate to PMD v3.2
* Migrate to Eclipse v3.1
* Add support for JDK 1.5
* Create a CPD report instead of displaying a window
* Fix Bug#1190624 (Completly refactor the CPD feature. see release notes)
* Fix other non documented bugs

**Development**
* Continuing the refactoring.
* Forgive "small" commands.
* Use Castor to serialize project properties inside the project itself and no more inside
  the workspace .metadata
* Small improvements in the Plugin class


## v3.0.1 - 07/05/2005

### v3.0RC2 (alias v3.0.1) - 07/05/2005


### FIXED : Tested on Eclipse 3.1M6

The problem for Eclipse v3.1 Mx version has been solved.
Because of this, now the project ruleset is always stored as a file (.ruleset) inside the project
itself. This file is created "lazyly": it will not be created unless necessary; so don't panic if
you cannot see it.

### FIXED (maybe?) : CPD report window for Mac users

The way the window is created has been changed. This should fix the problem.

### UPDATED: Xerces Implementation re-packaged inside the core plugin

When migrating for Eclipse v3 (and then Java 1.4), a special plugin for Xerces was created.
This has been forgiven and the XercesImpl.jar is now packaged inside the PMD Core plugin.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* Fix Bug#1144793
* Fix Bug#1190624 (try)
* Fix PMD violations
* Continue refactoring

**Development**
* Forgive the Xerces plungin and repackage the xercesImpl.jar inside the PMD Core plugin.


## v3.0.0 - 21/04/2005

### v3.0RC1 (alias v3.0.0) - 21/04/2005

### UPDATED : PMD Engine v3.0

Include the new PMD engine v3.0.


### NEW : Adding a report generation feature (RFE#1177802)

The plugin includes now the possibility to generate reports.
To generate reports, select a project and choose PMD->Generate Reports in the context menu.
4 reports will be generated in a "reports" directory at the project root: a HTML, CVS, TEXT
and XML report. These reports are the one generated by the renderers from the PMD Engine.

These reports are based on the PMD markers. Therefore, in order to work, PMD must be
activated for the project or a manual must be executed before. Otherwise reports will
be empty.

Future versions of the plugin will include report selection, automatic generation and filename
and targer folder customization.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* upgrade the core engine to PMD v3.0
* implement reports generation (RFE#1177802)


## v2.2.1 - 01/02/2005

**Runtime**
* upgrade the core engine to PMD v2.2


## v2.2.0 - 23/01/2005

### v2.2 (alias v2.2.0) - 23/01/2005

This relase is considered as stable (no more a release candidate).
The only bug it corrects is the management of the new "symboltable" and "dfa" rule
attributes.

It also includes PMD 2.1 and basically manages "// NOPMD" comments.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* upgrade the core engine to PMD v2.1 (fix 1095049)
* integrate to rule attributes when exporting rulesets (fix 1090032 & 1087079)


## v2.1.1 - 03/12/2004

**Runtime**
* implements the "NOPMD" feature

**Development**
* refining the refactoring of the property page
* implementing a Command framework


## v2.1.0 - 22/11/2004

### v2.1RC1 (alias v2.1.0) - 22/11/2004

Nothing very special in this release, but the confirmation of the new way of
downloading the plugin.

PMD core engine has been upgraded to v2.0.

This release is a candidate, because a refactoring of the plugin has begun.
The project property page is used as a test for this refactoring.
Do not hesitate to open bug if something goes wrong.

IMPORTANT: Lots of things have changed in PMD. There are  some rules that are now
XPath rules and have no more an implementation class. Because ruleset is cached,
upgrading may cause trouble. To correct this try first to delete the file
ruleset.xml in the .metadata\.plugins\net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse directory of your
workspace.

Also, some new rules causes exception in some circumstances. Just unselect them.
We are already working on this.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* update to PMD v2.0
* update the icons (thanks to Ebu)
* fix error in the fragment how to

**Development**
* begin the refactoring; apply MVC to GUIs; apply Command and CommandProcessor
  patterns for PMD and Eclipse resources operations.
* Before generalizing the refactoring, test on the property page.


## v2.0.6 - xx/07/2004

## v2.0.0 - 01/12/2003

### v2.0RC1 (alias v2.0.0) - 01/12/2003

As the plugin has become more complex, the plugin is now published with "release
candidates" technique. So, when a RC is published, only bugs are corrected before
a final release is published.


### UPDATED : Changing the deployment structure of the plugin

The plugin has been refactored to follow the standard deployment (installation)
procedures of Eclipse. PMD comes now into Eclipse as a "feature" and is composed
of two plugins : one for encapsulating PMD (net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse.core) and one for
the UI integration (net.sourceforge.pmd.eclipse).
A simple unzip doesn't work anymore, but using the update manager of Eclipse is required.
Please, read the instructions included in the setup_readme.txt file of the package
you downloaded from Sourceforge.

### NEW : Adding the "lazy check" feature

This feature comes to help "big" projects. Now, when PMD is enabled for a project, 
the plugin ask before checking the entire project. If the answer is no, the new options
are only applied when files are saved or added into the project.

### NEW : Adding the "working set" feature

This feature also comes for big projects. A working set can be configured by project
to filter files that have to be checked by PMD. Open the project properties dialog to
specify this working set.

### NEW : Using a project ruleset file

Instead of using the rulset configured in Eclipse preferences, it's possible to
configure projects to use a ruleset file from the project. This file must be named
".ruleset" and must be in the root directory of the project. When the option is enabled,
if the ruleset file doesn't exist, it is created.

### NEW : Previewing the Quickfix feature

The plugin comes with a preview of the future "quickfix" feature. This feature will
enable to use the Quickfix feature of Eclipse to correct rules violations. This version
provides a quickfix for the duplicate imports rule. The quickfix consists of deleting
the line where the violation occurs.

### UPDATED : Improving Eclipse v3 support

The plugin has been refactored so that it should now work for both Eclipse v2 and v3
under a JDK v1.3. But a Eclipse v2.10 minimum is still required.
This version has been tested whith Eclipse v2.11 and Eclipse v3M4.

### FIXED : Importing rules and rulesets

Various bug reports shared the same problem : XML parsing of ruleset files. This
parsing has been refactored (included in the PMD core engine) so that these bugs should
now be fixed. These bugs were about importing rulesets, modifying rules properties,...

### FIXED : Improving AST generation

The generation of the AST has been refactored so that it now uses introspection to
produce the tree. So now, no attributes should missed. Also, the XML output has been
reviewed so that the generated file should now be a valid XML file.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* Fixing bug #819518 : AST writes out method return types incorrectly
* Fixing bug #820241 : VariableDeclaration doesn't show variable modifiers
* Fixing bug #850242 : PMD working from time to time
* Fixing bug #849558 : Cannot use pmd-eclipse plugin with Eclipse 2.1.2
* Fixing bug #841110 : PMD-eclipse not working after rule import and restart
* Fixing bug #838054 : PMD cannot run inside Eclipse
* Fixing bug #832250 : plugin exception in 1.2
* Adding the lazy check feature : suggest to not rebuild the project when the properties has changed.
* Adding the working set feature
* Previewing quickfix feature
* Refactoring to remove Eclipse internal APIs usage
* Refactoring to use the Eclipse adaptable framework instead of downcasting (where possible)
* Refactoring to adapt to Eclipse v3


## v1.2.1 - 30/10/2003

**Runtime**
* Fixing JDK 1.3 runtime problem (for WSAD users for example)
  (thanks to Eduard Naum)
* Adding "scratchpad" ruleset in the drop down list when importing rulesets
* Refactoring JDK 1.3 compatibility feature so that it uses the compiler compliance option


## v1.2.0 - 27/10/2003

### NEW : Adding a JDK 1.3 compatibility option

With the upgrade to PMD 1.3, the plug-in now provide an option to flag the project to
be JDK1.3 compatible. If the flag is checked, the "assert" keyword will be processed by
PMD like a identifier. If the flag is unchecked, the "assert" will be processed as a
keyword.

### NEW : Adding a review feature

Some rules occured and nothing can be done to correct it (unused parameter in a
framework abstract method or interface method, complexity warning, deep ifs,...)
You cannot remove the rules from the configuration because other or future occurrences
are still needed. But if the rule is still used, then the violations view will be
polluted by the undesired violations.

To address this problem, the plug-in now provide a review feature. When a violation
occurs, if it cannot be corrected, then it can be marked as "reviewed". Reviews are
comments placed above the targeted line of code that avoid the violation to be raised
in future checks. As it is in the code, it is automatically shared with other developpers.

To learn more about this feature, please read the online documentation in the howto
chapter.

### FIX : Encoding of generated XML files

The plugin may generates 2 kind of XML files : rulesets file and AST files. Encoding
problems that were sometimes encountered are now fixed.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* Refactoring some classes to avoid the warnings about accessing private members from inner types.
* Adding the review feature (RFE#785023 and RFE#787086)
* Adding a Java 1.3 compatibility property for projects
* Upgrading to PMD 1.3.0
* Fixing encoding in rulesets (bug #810858)
* Fixing encoding of AST (bug #819520)

**Development**
* Rebuild the build.xml file according to the "Create Ant Build File" feature


## v1.1.2 - 11/08/2003

**Runtime**
* Fixing exception in violations view when display violations of a class in the default package
* Refactoring ruleset preferences. Moving the prefered ruleset from preference store to state location


## v1.1.1 - 05/08/2003

**Runtime**
* Updating to PMD v1.2.1
* Fixing CoreException when refreshing violations view with Eclipse v3


## v1.1.0 - 30/07/2003

### NEW : Redesigning the plugin configuration

Since the beginning, the plugin was configured by selecting globaly desired, already
written rulesets. Before v1.0.0, only rulesets from PMD was allowed or also, custom
rulesets packaged in a fragment plugin. Since then, rulesets can also be loaded from
standard file system.

Now, the plugin configuration is no more rulset based, but rule based. That is, you can
configure globaly what rules are to be used and configure them (change the priority level,
the description and the violation message). The rules can be imported from PMD rulesets
or from any custom ruleset. It's even possible to create new rules, such as XPath rules.

Finally, the configured rules can be enabled or disabled in the properties of each
project.

For more information, read the how to chapter about the plugin configuration.


### NEW : Adding a violation view

PMD violations are shown as problems (or tasks) in the tasks view. Some users do not like this
method to list violations.
Now, a special view has been designed to display only violations. This view works like
the tasks view, but displays informations differently. Also, this view provides filters
specific for PMD such as a sorter by priority level.
The users who do not want to use the tasks view any more may filter PMD markers to remove
them from the tasks view.

For more information, read the how to chapter about using the plugin.


### UPDATED : Grouping menu items

(request and patch from Christian J�ckel)
In order to be less intrusive in the context menu of the package and navigator views, PMD
menu items are now grouped in a submenu. This submenu is displayed by selecting the unique
entry "PMD" in the context menu of the desired view.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* Writing more docs (using PMD, using CPD, reporting bugs)
* Redesigning the way to configure the plugin (see doc)
* Adding a view that show PMD violations
* Grouping PMD menu items in a submenu to be less intrusive in the views context menu
* Updating to PMD v1.2


## v1.0.0 - 19/06/2003

### NEW : Adding a logging facility

The logging support is based on Log4J from Apache (see: http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j).
The default is to log at the warn level to the file "pmd-eclipse.log" using a rolling
file appender of 10 MB and one backup file.
The file is located in the {user.dir} directory which should be your Eclipse home
directory
To change these options, simply edit the "log4j.xml" file located in the plugin. Please
read the Log4J doc to learn how to update this file.

### NEW : PMD actions from folder and package popups

Now, PMD actions (check code and remove markers) are available from the popup menus of
a folder (resource navigator view) and package (package explorer view).

### NEW : On-line help

PMD documentation is now shipped with the plugin. Open the help contents and select
'PMD Plugin documentation'. The topic 'PMD Documentation' points to the PMD official
documentation. The chapter 'How to...' contains pages about some usual tasks with the
plugin.

### UPDATED

Lastest PMD Engine (v1.1).
Now, no more error message is displayed when PMD is executed against a file with syntax
errors.
The progress indicators are more accurate.
Violations are batch processed to speed up manual PMD invocation.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* Fixing SWTException when PMD is run on a file with syntax error
  (thanks to Chris Grindstaff)
* Generalize above fix for all message dialog in the plugin
* Adding logging facility to help support (using commons-logging and Log4J)
* Removing error dialog when PMD is executed on a file with syntax error
  (the PMD exception is logged as a warning)
* Adding PMD actions on folder and package popup menus
  (request from Vladimir Bossica)
* Processing markers changes as batch operations so that performances are improved.
* Updating PMD engine to v1.1
* Fixing CPD usage to conform to new engine implementation
* Improving progress indicators accurracy
* Adding online help that points to official PMD help and a howto section
* When generating an AST :
  * place image information as an attribute instead of the tag body
  * add other attributes (lines and cols) to all tags even those without children


## v0.5.0 - 19/03/2003

### NEW : Using PMD as a project incremental builder
When PMD is used as an incremental builder, then violations are added as problem marker. Then,
markers will be removed when violations are fixed.
To enable PMD as a incremental, simply check "enable PMD" on your project PMD property
page.

### UPDATED

When PMD is used "one shot" from the popup menu, then violations are added as task. Then, markers
should be removed manually via the popup menus, either from the project (all violations for this
project will be removed), or from a file or group of files (all violations for these files will be
removed) or from the task view (all violations for all projects will be removed).

PMD markers (violations) can be filtered in the task view : either PMD task marker or PMD problem
marker or both.

PMD rule violations have a priority from 1 to 5. Markers have only 3 level of severity, so the mapping is as follow :
PMD priority 1 -> severity error, priority high
PMD priority 2 -> severity error, priority normal
PMD priority 3 -> severity warning, priority high
PMD priority 4 -> severity warning, priority normal
PMD priority 5 -> severity information, priority normal

### MISC

PMD engine is not shipped with the source archive. Download it from source forge and install it in
a lib subdirectory.

### DETAILS

**Runtime**
* Adding PMD as a project incremental builder.
* Refactor some entries in the plugin.xml file.
* Adding a "Delete PMD marker" popup menu on project, java files and task view.
* Adding a "Generate AST" popup menu on java file.
* Enabling popups in resource view and package view
* Externalizing strings and messages.
* Adding support for i18n : english is the default locale and providing french as the
  first alternative locale.
* Using PMD v1.03

**Development**
* Adding a ant build file
* Adapting .project to be compatible with both Eclipse 2.02 and WSAD v5.
